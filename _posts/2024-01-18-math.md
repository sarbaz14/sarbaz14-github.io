In the name of Allah. 

Mathematics is a world of beauty. The more we get familiar with mathematics, the more we understand its beauty. One of the beauties of mathematics is the shapes created by the function diagram. For example, the function diagram below forms a heart-shaped graph:

$$ ((x^2 + y^2 -1)^3) -(x^2)(y^3) $$

The image of the diagram of this relationship:

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/heart.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
