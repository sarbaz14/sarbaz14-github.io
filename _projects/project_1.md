A chatting web application where all the messages are routed through The Onion Routing (TOR) service. Each user can talk anonymously to anyone. Every userâ€™s display name is also randomized to ensure that users do not risk their privacy by keeping their real name. Messages are auto-deleted upon refresh; thus no information is stored at the server-side. Chat rooms can be created, and the code can be shared to chat with known people but with their messages being routed through the TOR service.
