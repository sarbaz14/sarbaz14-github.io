Writing a PhD thesis is convenient in scrivener (not to mention fun), but it is hard to format it later. Latex is perfect to beautify the thesis, but hard to write a thesis in without getting caught up in formating. I came up with workflow while working on my thesis to get the best of both worlds.

Because of its usefulness, and because it powered a couple more thesis apart from mine, I made sure that the Github page has really detailed instructions. If this is of interest, check it out [here](https://github.com/AbstractGeek/scrivener-latex)
